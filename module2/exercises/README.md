# Hands-On Exercise 2: Student Grading System

## Tasks
- Define a new class with a `main` method. 
- Define variables for **midterm grade**, **final grade**, and **total grade**.
- Ask the user to enter the **midterm grade** (integer or double).
- Ask the user to enter the **final grade**.
- Store these values in the respective variables.
- Print them back to confirm input.
- Assume the weights are:
    - Midterm: **40%**
    - Final: **60%**
- Calculate the **total grade** using the formula:
  - Total Grade = (Midterm × 0.4) + (Final × 0.6)
- Print the total grade to the screen.
