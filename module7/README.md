## Fundamentals Of Web Applications And Web Services

There are several services on the Internet, and the **Web (World Wide Web)** is one of the most widely used.

The Web consists of various resources—such as websites, web pages, files, data services, and functions—that can be 
accessed through applications like web browsers or web services.

**What is a URL?**

A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is the address of a resource on the Web. It specifies 
**where to find** and **how to access** a Web resource.

**Parts of a URL:**

A URL typically consists of:
- **Protocol:** Defines how to access the resource (e.g., `https://`, `http://`).
- **Domain Name:** The website's name (e.g., `example.com`).
- **Path (Optional):** Specifies a **resource** on the server (e.g., `/about`).

**Example URL:**

`https://www.example.com/about`
- `https://` → Secure protocol
- `www.example.com` → Website domain
- `/about` → Specific resource (page, file, function etc.)

**Applications can identify and send requests to a resource using the URL.**

### Client Server Architecture

A **client–server architecture** divides an application into two main components:
- The **client**, which **initiates requests** (e.g., a web browser or mobile app).
- The **server**, which **waits for incoming requests**, processes them, and sends back responses.

> **Key point:** In this model, the **server cannot initiate communication** — it only responds to requests from the client.

This design centralizes data and logic on the server, making systems easier to manage, update, and secure.

### Three-tier Web Architecture


The **Three-Tier Web Architecture** is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three logical layers:

1. **Presentation Tier (Client Layer)** – The front-end where users interact with the application (e.g., web browser, mobile app).
2. **Application Tier (Business Logic Layer)** – The back-end server that handle requests and implements business logic.
3. **Data Tier (Database Layer)** – The database that stores and retrieves data.

### UML Deployment Diagram

A UML Deployment Diagram provides information regarding the deployment of software products
(artifacts/components) onto nodes (such as devices, operating systems, virtual machines, etc.). 
It illustrates the physical topology where the software is deployed.

<img src="../resources/deployment-diagram.png" width="400">



### Web Application Architecture - Synchronous Communication

In **synchronous communication**, the client sends a request and **waits** for the server to respond before continuing.
- Commonly implemented using **HTTP** (e.g., RESTful APIs).
- Used for operations where an immediate response is required.
- Example: Submitting a login form and waiting for authentication results.


![Web Application Architecture](../resources/web-application-architecture-synchronous.png)


### Web Application Architecture - Asynchronous Communication

In **asynchronous communication**, the client sends a request and continues executing without waiting for a response.
- Often implemented using **message queues**, **WebSockets**, or **AJAX**.
- Enables **non-blocking** interaction and better performance for real-time updates.
- Example: Attaching a large file to an email — the upload continues in the background while the user can still compose the message.

![Web Application Architecture](../resources/web-application-architecture-asynchronous.png)


### Scalable Web Application Architecture

A **scalable architecture** is designed to handle increasing workloads efficiently by adding more resources.  
It typically involves:
- **Load balancing** (distributing requests across multiple servers).
- **Database replication or sharding**.
- **Caching** (e.g., Redis) to reduce repeated computations.
- **Microservices** or containerized deployments for modular growth.

Scalability ensures consistent performance as user demand grows.

![Web Application Architecture](../resources/scalable-web-architecture.png)


### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is an architectural pattern in which software components are structured as 
independent services.

Each service performs a specific business function and communicates with other services through standardized interfaces 
and language-agnostic protocols, typically over HTTP or messaging queues.

For instance; in a banking system, separate services may handle account management, fund transfers, and customer notifications, all interacting through service interfaces.

**Key Characteristics of SOA:**

- **Loose Coupling**: Services are designed to be independent, minimizing dependencies.
- **Interoperability**: Services can work across different platforms and technologies.
- **Reusability**: Services can be reused in different applications.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.

**Simple Two-Service Communication Diagram**

```plaintext
+----------------+       HTTP / Message Queue     +----------------+
|  Service A     | -----------------------------> |  Service B     |
|                |                                |                |
| (Client)       | <----------------------------- | (Provider)     |
+----------------+                                +----------------+
```
In this diagram:

* Service A acts as a client (consumer) that sends a request to Service B.
* Service B processes the request and sends back a response to Service A.
* Communication between web services can be achieved using HTTP-based protocols such as REST and SOAP, remote procedure 
call (RPC) frameworks like gRPC or XML-RPC, or asynchronous messaging systems such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.

### Microservice Architecture

**Microservice Architecture** is a modern derivative (or evolution) of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

It is an architectural pattern where an application is composed of small, independent services 
that communicate over a network. 

Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and can be developed, 
deployed, and scaled independently.

**Key Characteristics of Microservice Architecture:**
- **Decentralization**: Each service has its own database and business logic.
- **Independence**: Services can be developed and deployed independently.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled individually based on demand.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service does not necessarily affect the entire system.
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies and programming languages.

## Introduction to Node.js

### Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side.
It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome, to execute code outside of a web browser.

Key Features of Node.js:

    Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and 
    suitable for real-time applications.
    
    Single-Threaded: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle many connections concurrently thanks to 
    its event loop.
    
    NPM (Node Package Manager): Node.js comes with NPM, which is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries 
    in the world.
    
    Scalability: Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.


Use Cases:

    Web Servers: Building fast and scalable web servers.
    APIs: Creating RESTful APIs for web and mobile applications.
    Real-Time Applications: Developing chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools.

**For the details of Node.js, refer to https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/**

### NPM (Node Package Manager)
It is a package manager for JavaScript, and it is the default package manager for Node.js.

It allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies (libraries and tools) for their projects.

* Key Features of NPM:
  - Package Management: Easily install and manage third-party libraries and tools.
  - Version Control: Keep track of different versions of packages to ensure compatibility.
  - Dependency Management: Automatically handle dependencies required by installed packages.
  - Script Running: Define and run scripts for various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying applications.
* Basic Commands:
  - npm init: Initialize a new Node.js project.
  - npm install <package>: Install a package and add it to the project's dependencies.
  - npm update: Update all installed packages to their latest versions.
  - npm run: Run a script defined in the package.json file.

### Node.js & npm Installation

**Setting Up the Development Environment**


* Download Node.js from here (https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install it properly.

* Set up Intellij for Node.js based development (or install WebStorm)
  - IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Plugins -> Node.js (OSX, Linux)
  - IntelliJ IDEA -> File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Node.js (Windows)
    
* Initialize a new Node.js project
  - IntelliJ IDEA -> File -> New -> Project -> Empty Project (Give the project an appropriate name.)
  - Open the terminal in IntelliJ
  - npm init -y
  - Make a /src folder for the source code of the project

* Make a hello-world.js file and write the following code:
  - console.log('Hello world.');
        
* Run the app:
  - node hello-world.js

### Sequential and Event-Driven Programming Models

Traditional programming languages often follow a sequential (blocking) model, where each statement executes one after 
another, and the program waits for each operation to complete before continuing.

In contrast, event-driven systems use non-blocking I/O. For long-running operations such as network requests or file 
reads, the system registers the operation and immediately continues executing other tasks. When the operation 
completes, an event is emitted and the callback function (or async handler) is executed.

This approach reduces CPU idle time and is ideal for I/O-intensive applications. Sequential (blocking) systems, 
however, remain more suitable for CPU-intensive workloads, where operations are computation-heavy rather than I/O-bound.

#### Traditional blocking(sequential/synchronous) operation in Node.js


**Code Example: /part1/blocking.js**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Writing messages to the console
console.log('Start');

console.log('Message 1');

console.log('Message 2');
// Reading a file (Synchronous)
try {
    const data = fs.readFileSync('sample-data.md', 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
} catch (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
}

console.log('End');

```

### Non-blocking (asynchronous) operations in Node.js

* Event Loop Example

**Code Example: /part1/non-blocking.js**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Writing messages to the console
console.log('Start');

// Wait 2 sec (asynchronous / non-blocking)
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Message 1');
}, 2000);

// Wait 10 ms (asynchronous / non-blocking)
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Message 2');
}, 10);

// Reading a file (asynchronous / non-blocking)
fs.readFile('sample-data.md', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('End');
```
**Explanation of Execution Order**

1. "Start" is printed to the console first (synchronous).
2. setTimeout is registered but executed 2 seconds later. When the time is up, the statements inside setTimeout are executed.
3. setTimeout is registered but executed 10 ms later. When the time is up, the statements inside setTimeout are executed.
4. fs.readFile is non-blocking, so the file-reading operation starts immediately, and the callback is 
executed after the operation is completed.
5. "end" is printed to the console (synchronous).
6. The event loop handles setTimeout, setTimeout, and fs.readFile callbacks after the main script execution is completed.

* Event Loop Example for Simulator: https://jsflow.info

**Code Example**
```javascript
//const fs = require('fs');

// Writing messages to the console
console.log('Start');

// Wait 2 sec (asynchronous / non-blocking)
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Message 1');
}, 2000);

// Wait 10 ms (asynchronous / non-blocking)
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Message 2');
}, 10);

// Simulated asynchronous file read
console.log('Start reading file...');

setTimeout(() => {
    const fakeData = 'Sample data from file simulation.';
    console.log('File content:', fakeData);
}, 1000); // simulate 1-second file read delay

console.log('Reading initiated...');

console.log('End');
```

### Basic JSON Operations

**Code Example: /part1/json.js**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs'); // Import File System module

// Sample product JSON object
const product = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Laptop",
    category: "Electronics",
    price: 1000,
    stock: 50
};

// Convert JSON to string and write it to a file
fs.writeFileSync('product.json', JSON.stringify(product, null, 2));
console.log("JSON file has been stored successfully.");

// Read JSON data from the file
const rawData = fs.readFileSync('product.json', 'utf8');
const productData = JSON.parse(rawData); // Convert JSON string to JavaScript object
console.log("\nRead JSON from file:", productData);

// Basic JSON Operations

// 1. Access properties
console.log("Product Name:", productData.name);
console.log("Category:", productData["category"]);

// 2. Modify properties
productData.price = 1200;  // Update price
productData.stock += 10;  // Increase stock by 10

// 3. Add a new property
productData.discount = 10;

// 4. Delete a property
delete productData.stock;


// Write the updated JSON back to the file
fs.writeFileSync('product.json', JSON.stringify(productData, null, 2));
console.log("\nUpdated JSON file saved.");

```





## Developing Web Applications Using HTML,CSS, JS, and Node.js

**Code Example: A Simple Web Server**

/part1/web-server.js

```javascript
/**
 * This is a straightforward web server built with Express.js.
 * Express.js is a lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js that simplifies building web applications and APIs.
 * It serves static HTML pages from the "public" folder.
 */

const express = require('express'); // Import the Express.js framework
const path = require('path'); // Import the built-in Node.js 'path' module

const app = express(); // Initialize an Express application
const PORT = 3000; // Define the port number where the server will listen

// Middleware to serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from the 'public' folder.
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); 
// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

**Code Example: /part1/public/index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello World !
</body>
</html>
```
### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for crafting web pages. 
    
    It structures content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. 
    
    Browsers interpret HTML to display web pages visually. 
    
    It works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

**For the details of HTML, refer to https://www.w3schools.com/html/**

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the appearance of HTML elements. 
    
    CSS is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness of web pages to ensure a consistent 
    and attractive design across different devices and screen sizes.

**For the details of CSS, refer to https://www.w3schools.com/css/**

### JavaScript

    JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. 
    
    It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events like clicks or keyboard input, and fetch data 
    from servers without reloading the page. 

**For the details of JavaScript, refer to https://www.w3schools.com/js/**



## jQuery and Basic Form Operations for User Interaction

**What is jQuery?**

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library designed to simplify:
- HTML DOM traversal and manipulation
- Event handling
- Animations
- AJAX interactions

**Why Use jQuery?**

- **Simplifies JavaScript code** – Reduces the need for writing long vanilla JavaScript functions.
- **Cross-browser compatibility** – Works across different browsers without issues.
- **Powerful event handling** – Allows easy manipulation of events like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
- **AJAX support** – Enables smooth data loading without refreshing the page.

**Adding jQuery to a Web Page**

You can include jQuery in your project via a **CDN**:

`<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>`

or download and reference it locally:

`<script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>`



**Basic jQuery Syntax**

jQuery follows a simple syntax:

`$(selector).action();`

- **`$`** – The jQuery function.
- **`selector`** – Selects an HTML element (e.g., `#id`, `.class`, `tag`).
- **`action()`** – The operation to perform (e.g., `hide()`, `show()`, `click()`).

**For the following jQuery code snippets, you are required to use a Node.js-based web application.
You must embed these code snippets into a HTML file.**

**Example: Hiding a Paragraph on Click**
1. Add a button and a paragraph in your HTML.
2. Use jQuery to hide the paragraph when the button is clicked.

**Code Example**
```javascript
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<button id="hide-btn">Hide</button>
<p id="text">This is a paragraph.</p>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#hide-btn").click(function(){
            $("#text").hide();
        })
    });
</script>

```


### **Handling Form Input Fields**

**Selecting Form Elements**
You can get and set values in form fields using `.val()`:

1. Form an input field and a button.
2. When the button is clicked, retrieve the value entered in the input field.
3. Display the value dynamically.

**Code Example**
```javascript
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
<button id="get-name">Get Name</button>
<p id="output"></p>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#get-name").click(function(){
            var name = $("#name").val();
            $("#output").text("Hello, " + name);
        })
    });
</script>

```

**Form Events Handling**

jQuery provides event handlers for form elements, such as:

- `focus()` – When an input field is focused.
- `blur()` – When an input field loses focus.
- `change()` – When the value of an input field changes.
- `submit()` – When a form is submitted.

**Code Example: Form Submission Handling**
```javascript
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<form id="user-form">
    <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Enter username" required>
    <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter password" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<p id="message"></p>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#user-form").submit(function(event){
            event.preventDefault(); // Prevents page reload
            var username = $("#username").val();
            $("#message").text("Form submitted! Welcome, " + username);
        });
    });
</script>

```


**Enabling and Disabling Form Fields**

Use `.prop()` to enable or disable input fields dynamically.

**Code Example**
```javascript
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<input type="text" id="email" disabled>
<button id="enable-btn">Enable Input</button>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#enable-btn").click(function(){
            $("#email").prop("disabled", false);
        });
    });
</script>
```

**Real-time Input Validation**

Validate user input dynamically using the `.keyup()` event.

**Code Example**
```javascript
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<input type="text" id="phone" placeholder="Enter phone number">
<p id="validation-msg"></p>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#phone").keyup(function(){
            var input = $(this).val();
            if (/^\d{10}$/.test(input)) {
                $("#validation-msg").text("Valid number").css("color", "green");
            } else {
                $("#validation-msg").text("Invalid number").css("color", "red");
            }
        });
    });
</script>
```

## Developing RESTful APIs

### What is a RESTful API?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style (or a set of principles) for designing networked applications.

RESTful refers to web services that adhere to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). 

RESTful is an approach for building scalable, stateless web APIs that use standard HTTP methods and principles.


**Key Characteristics**

1. **HTTP Methods**: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:

   | **HTTP Method** | **Usage** |
   |---------------|---------|
   | `GET`        | Retrieve resource (Read) |
   | `POST`       | Add new resource (Insert) |
   | `PUT`        | Update existing resource (Replace) |
   | `PATCH`      | Update a specific part of resource (Modify) |
   | `DELETE`     | Remove resource |

2. **Resource-Based**: RESTful APIs use resources, which are identified by URLs.
   A resource could be a user, a product, or a function to control a heating system.

3. **JSON or XML**: Data is typically exchanged in JSON or XML format, with JSON being more common due to its 
   simplicity and ease of use.

4. **Stateless**: The server does not store any client context between requests.

**Example Endpoints**

- **GET /users**: Retrieve a list of users.
- **POST /users**: Add a new user.
- **GET /users/{id}**: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
- **PUT /users/{id}**: Update a specific user by ID.
- **DELETE /users/{id}**: Delete a specific user by ID.
- **GET /heating-system/status**: Retrieve the current status of the heating system.
- **POST /heating-system/on**: Turn on the heating system.
- **POST /heating-system/off**: Turn off the heating system.
- **PUT /heating-system/temperature**: Set the desired temperature of the heating system.

### ### Route definition in Express.js

A **route** in Express.js defines an endpoint where clients send requests to interact with the service.

Each route consists of:

1. **An HTTP method** (GET, POST, etc.)
2. **A URL pattern** (e.g., `/api/customers/:id`)
3. **A callback function / route handler ** to handle the request

Example of a simple route in Express.js:

**Code Example**

```javascript
app.get("/api/customers", (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "List of customers" });
});
```

### A simple Node.js-based RESTful API

**Code Example: /part2/server.js**


```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON requests

// In-memory database: JSON array for products
let products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 999.99 },
  { id: 2, name: "Phone", price: 499.99 },
];

// Route definations
// Routes are the connection points (end points - addresses) in a web service where clients send requests to interact with the service.
// GET all products
app.get("/api/products", (req, res) => {
  res.json(products); // Respond with the list of all products
});

// GET a single product by ID
app.get("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id)); // Find the product by ID
  if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" }); // If not found, respond with 404
  res.json(product); // Respond with the found product
});

// POST - Add a new product
app.post("/api/products", (req, res) => {
  const { name, price } = req.body; // Extract name and price from the request body
  if (!name || !price) return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid input" }); // Validate input

  const newProduct = { id: products.length + 1, name, price }; // Add a new product with a unique ID
  products.push(newProduct); // Add the new product to the list
  res.status(201).json(newProduct); // Respond with the added product
});

// PUT - Update a product
app.put("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id)); // Find the product by ID
  if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" }); // If not found, respond with 404

  const { name, price } = req.body; // Extract name and price from the request body
  product.name = name || product.name; // Update the product name if provided
  product.price = price || product.price; // Update the product price if provided
  res.json(product); // Respond with the updated product
});

// DELETE - Remove a product
app.delete("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  products = products.filter((p) => p.id !== parseInt(req.params.id)); // Remove the product by ID
  res.json({ message: "Product deleted" }); // Respond with a deletion message
});

// Start server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)); // Start the server on port 3000
```

**Endpoints (Routes) of the developed API**

        GET http://localhost:3000/api/products

        GET http://localhost:3000/api/products/1

        POST http://localhost:3000/api/products
        Content-Type: application/json
        {
        "name": "Tablet",
        "price": 299.99
        }

        PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/2
        Content-Type: application/json
        {
        "name": "Smartphone",
        "price": 550.00
        }
    
        DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/products/1


### REST Clients - Testing REST api using cURL and http client

    curl --version
    if not installed -> Download cURL from: https://curl.se/windows/


```sh
# Retrieves a list of all products from the database.

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/products

---

# Fetches details of a specific product using its ID.

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/products/1

---

# Adds a new product to the database. The request body must contain name and price in JSON format.

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/products \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Tablet", "price": 299.99}'


---

# Updates the details of an existing product using its ID. Any missing fields will retain their previous values.

curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Updated Laptop", "price": 1099.99}'

---

# Deletes a product from the database by specifying its ID.

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/products/1


```

### **Converting a Simple RESTful API into a Web Application with jQuery**


This section explains how to convert the existing **REST API** into a **web application** by developing web pages that allow users to interact with the API using **jQuery**.

The web application will provide:
- A **product list** fetched from the API.
- A **form to add new products**.
- Options to **update and delete products** dynamically.
- jQuery-based **AJAX requests** to communicate with the API.


**Steps to Convert the API into a Web Application**
1. **Retain the existing REST API** as the backend.
2. **Develop frontend web pages** to interact with the API.
3. **Use jQuery** to fetch, display, add, update, and delete products.
4. **Implement event handling** using jQuery to interact with the API.
5. **Enhance user experience** with jQuery effects.


**Step 1: Modify the API** (`/part2/server.js`)

We will slightly modify the existing API to serve **static HTML files** in addition to handling RESTful requests.

**Code Example: /part2/server.js**

```javascript

const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const app = express();
const cors = require("cors"); // Import CORS


app.use(express.json()); // parse json requests
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // Middleware to serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from the 'public' folder


app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all routes
// The browser blocks cross-origin requests unless the server explicitly allows them.
// Cross-Origin means that the protocol, domain, or port is different between the frontend and backend.

// In-memory database: JSON array for products
let products = [
    { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 999.99 },
    { id: 2, name: "Phone", price: 499.99 },
];

// Route definations
//Routes are the connection points (addresses) in a web service where clients send requests to interact with the server.
// GET all products
app.get("/api/products", (req, res) => {
    res.json(products);
});

// GET a single product by ID
app.get("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
    const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
    res.json(product);
});

// POST - Add a new product
app.post("/api/products", (req, res) => {
    const { name, price } = req.body;
    if (!name || !price) return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid input" });

    const newProduct = { id: products.length + 1, name, price };
    products.push(newProduct);
    res.status(201).json(newProduct);
});

// PUT - Update a product
app.put("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
    const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });

    const { name, price } = req.body;
    product.name = name || product.name;
    product.price = price || product.price;
    res.json(product);
});

// DELETE - Remove a product
app.delete("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
    products = products.filter((p) => p.id !== parseInt(req.params.id));
    res.json({ message: "Product deleted" });
});

// Start server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```


**Step 2: Develop Frontend Web Pages**

Inside a folder named public/, add an index.html file. This will be the main page where users
can view, add, update, and delete products using jQuery.

**Code Example: /part2/public/index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        table { width: 50%; margin: auto; border-collapse: collapse; }
        th, td { border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; }
        .error { color: red; display: none; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Product List</h2>
    <!-- Table to display products -->

                <th>Price</th>
                <th>Actions</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="product-list"></tbody> <!-- Products will be dynamically inserted here -->
    </table>

    <h2>Add Product</h2>
    <!-- Form to add a new product -->
    <form id="add-product-form">
        <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Product Name" required>

    <p class="error" id="error-msg">Invalid inputtttttttt</p> <!-- Error message for validation -->

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function(){
            // Function to load products asynchronously using AJAX (GET request)
            function loadProducts() {
                $.get("/api/products", function(products){
                    $("#product-list").empty(); // Clear the existing list
                    products.forEach(product => {
                        $("#product-list").append(`
                            <tr>
                                <td>${product.id}</td>
                                <td>${product.name}</td>

                            </tr>
                        `);
                    });
                });
            }

            // Handle form submission to add a new product (AJAX POST request)
            $("#add-product-form").submit(function(event){
                event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission
                var name = $("#name").val().trim(); // Get product name
                var price = parseFloat($("#price").val().trim()); // Get product price

                // Validate input: Ensure name is not empty and price is valid
                if (!name || isNaN(price) || price <= 0) {
                    $("#error-msg").fadeIn().delay(5000).fadeOut();
                    return;
                }

                // Asynchronous request to add a product
                $.post({
                    url: "/api/products",

                    success: function(response) {
                        loadProducts(); // Refresh product list after adding
                        console.log("Product added:", response);
                        $("#name").val(""); // Clear input fields

                    }
                });
            });

            // Handle product deletion (AJAX DELETE request)
            $("#product-list").on("click", ".delete-btn", function() {

                // Perform the deletion logic here
                $.ajax({
                    url: `/api/products/${id}`,

**Step 3: Add search and update functionalities to the web app**

**Code Example: /part2/server.js**

```javascript
// GET all products
app.get("/api/products", (req, res) => {
    // Accesses the name parameter from the query string in an Express.js request object.
    const query = req.query.name?.toLowerCase() || ""; 

    if (query) {
        const filteredProducts = products.filter(product =>
            product.name.toLowerCase().includes(query)
        );
        return res.json(filteredProducts);
    }

    res.json(products);
});

```

### Routers and Routes in Express.js

An **Express Router** helps organize routes by grouping them into separate files. This makes the code 
modular, manageable, and scalable.

Benefits of Using a Router
* Code organization – Keeps web-app-server.js clean and structured.
* Reusability – Routes can be modular and reusable across different parts of the application.
* Easier maintenance – Adding new routes does not clutter the main server file.

**Code Example: /part2/server.js**

Modify the existing code to include the router.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const productRoutes = require("./routes/products"); // Import product routes

const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON requests


// Use product routes
app.use("/api/products", productRoutes);

// Start server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

```

**Code Example: /part2/routes/products.js**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// In-memory database: Array to store product data
let products = [
    { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 999.99 },
    { id: 2, name: "Phone", price: 499.99 },
];

// GET all products
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.json(products);
});

// GET a single product by ID
router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
    const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });
    res.json(product);
});

// POST - Add a new product
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
    const { name, price } = req.body;
    if (!name || !price) return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid input" });

    const newProduct = { id: products.length + 1, name, price };
    products.push(newProduct);
    res.status(201).json(newProduct);
});

// PUT - Update a product
router.put("/:id", (req, res) => {
    const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });

    const { name, price } = req.body;
    product.name = name || product.name;
    product.price = price || product.price;
    res.json(product);
});

// DELETE - Remove a product
router.delete("/:id", (req, res) => {
    products = products.filter((p) => p.id !== parseInt(req.params.id));
    res.json({ message: "Product deleted" });
});

module.exports = router;
```


## Database Integration

To perform database operations using application programs, **database drivers** are essential.
Drivers facilitate communication between the programming language and the database.


**Database Operations with Node.js and PostgreSQL**

* Setting up the PostgreSQL db
```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
---------------------------
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

```
**Code Example: A simple REST API with CRUD operations**

/part3/server.js

```javascript
//npm install express pg
// Import necessary modules

const express = require("express");
const { Pool } = require("pg"); // PostgreSQL client (db driver)

const app = express();

// Initialize a new PostgreSQL connection pool

const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'postgres',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'testdb',
    password: 'LecturePassword',
    port: 5432,
});

/*const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: "postgresql://postgres:LecturePassword@localhost:5432/testdb",
});*/


// Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// ------------------------ GET all products ------------------------
app.get("/api/products", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Fetch all products from the database
        const result = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id ASC");

        // Respond with JSON data
        res.json(result.rows);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Database error" }); // Handle errors
    }
});

// ------------------------ GET a single product by ID ------------------------
app.get("/api/products/:id", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { id } = req.params; // Extract product ID from URL

        // Query database for the given product ID
        const result = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = $1", [id]);

        if (result.rows.length === 0)
            return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });

        // Respond with the found product
        res.json(result.rows[0]);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Database error" });
    }
});

// ------------------------ POST - Add a new product ------------------------
app.post("/api/products", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { name, price } = req.body; // Extract product details from request body

        // Validate input (ensure name and price are provided)
        if (!name || !price)
            return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid input" });

        // Insert new product into the database
        const result = await pool.query(         //executes the query asynchronously using the PostgreSQL connection pool.
            "INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ($1, $2) RETURNING *", //$1, $2 are placeholders for parameterized queries, preventing SQL injection. // RETURNING * makes PostgreSQL return the newly inserted row.
            [name, price] //name, price] is an array of values that replaces $1 and $2 in the query.
        );

        // Respond with the newly added product
        res.status(201).json(result.rows[0]);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Database error" });
    }
});

// ------------------------ PUT - Update a product ------------------------
app.put("/api/products/:id", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { id } = req.params;
        const { name, price } = req.body;

        // Update the product in the database if it exists
        const result = await pool.query(
            "UPDATE products SET name = COALESCE($1, name), price = COALESCE($2, price) WHERE id = $3 RETURNING *",
            [name, price, id]   //COALESCE($1, name) ensures that if $1 (the provided value for name) is NULL or not given, the existing name value in the database remains unchanged.
        );

        if (result.rows.length === 0)
            return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });

        // Respond with the updated product
        res.json(result.rows[0]);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Database error" });
    }
});

// ------------------------ DELETE - Remove a product ------------------------
app.delete("/api/products/:id", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { id } = req.params;

        // Delete the product from the database
        const result = await pool.query("DELETE FROM products WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *", [id]);

        if (result.rows.length === 0)
            return res.status(404).json({ error: "Product not found" });

        // Respond with a success message
        res.json({ message: "Product deleted" });
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: "Database error" });
    }
});

// ------------------------ Start server ------------------------
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`));
