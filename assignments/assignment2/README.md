# Assignment 2 — Web Service Development for E-Commerce System

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to design and develop a **web-based e-commerce service** using **Node.js** and either **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**.  

This assignment emphasizes **web service design**, **API development**, and **database integration** using modern backend technologies.

## Tasks/Requirements

The system represents an **E-Commerce platform** that supports:
- Managing customers and employees
- Managing products and inventory
- Adding and viewing orders
- Placing new orders linked to specific customers and products

The backend service should:
- Store and retrieve data using PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Handle requests and responses in **JSON format**
- Use appropriate **HTTP methods** and **status codes**


1. Develop a **web service** using **Node.js**.
2. Use one of the following databases:
   - **PostgreSQL** 
   - **MongoDB** 
3. Implement the following operations (services):
- **Customer**: Add, update, list, view, and delete customer records.
- **Employee**: Manage employees and their roles.
- **Product**: Add new products, update inventory, list products, and remove them.
- **Order**: Add new orders, view order details, and calculate totals.
- **Placing an Order**: Associate orders with customers and products.

4. Provide  **simple interfaces (frontend)** for testing the services.
5. Perform REST API testing using any of the following:
   - HTTP client
   - curl
   - Postman
   - Equivalent testing tool
6. Include a **UML Deployment Diagram** and a **Database ER Diagram** (or Document Model for MongoDB).

7. **Documentation**
    - Provide a **report** containing:
        - Requirement analysis
        - UML deployment diagram
        - Design and Implementation notes
        - Include the Git repository address or the source code as an annex to the report.

8. **Presentation & Oral Exam**
    - Run your application in front of the instructor.
    - Present and explain your report.
    - Defend your design and code.

## Deliverables
- A working **Node.js project** implementing RESTful APIs.
- Documentation report (PDF file).
- A **simple interface** for API testing.

## Evaluation Criteria
***
The assignment will be evaluated based on two primary components:

1) Project Implementation: The quality and effectiveness of the project you implement.

2) Oral Exam Performance: Your performance during the oral exam, which will take place during your lab class in Week 13 ( the week starting November 24, 2025 ).

- **Correctness** (Does the application meet the requirements?).
- **Code Quality** (Readable, well-structured, meaningful names).
- **Deployment Diagram** (Accurate and consistent with implementation).
- **Documentation** (Completeness and clarity).
- **Oral Defense** (Understanding and ability to explain design and code).

---

## Oral Exam Requirements

The oral exam is **mandatory** as part of the evaluation process. Students will be assessed 
based on their understanding of the material presented in their **reports** and **source code**.

### **During the Oral Exam:**
- Reports must be **open** and accessible.
- Source code must be **ready to show** in the IDE.
- Application must be **ready to run** for demonstration.

---

## Group Work
Students must complete the assignment **individually**.  

---

## Report Structure
While there is no standard template for the report, it must include the following essential components:

### 1. Cover Page
Student Information: Include your full name, student ID, course name, and date of submission.

Title of the Report: Clearly state the title of your study or project.

### 2. Study Explanation
The report must provide the explanation of your study, including:

- Objective: Clearly outline the purpose and goals of your study.
- Requirement analysis
- UML Deployment Diagram
- ER Diagram (or Document Model for MongoDB)
- Description of API endpoints and their functionality.
- Design and Implementation notes
- The Git repository address or the source code as an annex to the report.
- Conclusion: Summarize the key points and findings of your study.

### 3. Additional Recommendations

Ensure that your report is well-organized and free of grammatical errors.

Use clear headings and subheadings to enhance readability.

---

## Email Submission

Students are required to attach their report as a PDF file and submit it via **email (cceken@ku.edu.kz)** before the oral examination.

* Email Subject: Use the following format for the subject line of your email:
    - ict-assignment2-StudentFullName
* File Naming: Ensure that the report file is named appropriately, using the following format:
    - StudentFullName-assignment2-report.pdf
---


## Late Submission and Oral Exam Policy
Students must submit their **reports and source code** before the **oral exam** (during their lab class in **Week 13**), 
as the oral exam time is crucial for evaluation.

If students are unable to attend the scheduled oral exam, they will be allowed to defend their project one week 
later during lab class hours.

However, this late defense of the oral exam will result in a 20% penalty on the total grade.

**Please note that there will not be another opportunity to defend the project beyond this timeframe.**

---

### By adhering to these guidelines and policies, you will ensure that your submission is complete and meets the evaluation criteria. 

***Good luck with your projects and oral exams!***
