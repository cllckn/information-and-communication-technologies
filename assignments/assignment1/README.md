# Assignment1: Design and Implementation of a Console-Based E-Commerce System using Java

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to design and develop a simple **console-based e-commerce system** using **Java classes** and **inheritance**.  
Students will practice object-oriented programming principles such as **class design**, **attributes and methods**, **encapsulation**, and **inheritance**.

## Requirements
1. The system must allow:
    - Managing **Users** (e.g., Customer, Employee).
    - Managing **Products** (e.g., Book, Electronics, Clothing).
    - Managing **Orders** (an order contains products purchased by a customer).
    - Handling **basic operations** like:
        - Adding products and users to the system.
        - Listing available users and products.
        - Customers placing an order. Viewing all orders.

2. Each object must have appropriate **attributes** and **methods**. Examples:
    - **User**: name, email, password, role (customer/employee).
    - **Product**: id, name, price, stockQuantity, displayInfo().
    - **Order**: orderId, customer, list of products, totalAmount, printReceipt().

3. Apply **inheritance**:
    - `User` class → extended by `Customer` and `Employee`.
    - `Product` class → extended by `Book`, `Electronics`, `Clothing`.

4. Apply **encapsulation**:
    - All attributes must be private.
    - Provide **getters and setters** for controlled access.

5. Use **collections** (`ArrayList`) to store users, products, and orders.

6. Interact with the user via the **console**:
    - Use `Scanner` for input.
    - Display menus (e.g.,  Customer Menu, Employee Menu,).
    - Let users choose actions such as *list products*, *add product*, *place order*, *view orders*, etc..

## Tasks

1. **Requirement Analysis**
    - Read the requirements above and identify **objects**, **attributes**, and **methods**.

2. **Object Modeling**
    - Extract objects from requirements.
    - Identify relationships (inheritance, association).

3. **UML Class Diagram**
    - Draw a UML class diagram showing classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.

4. **Implementation**
    - Define packages and Java classes.
    - Implement attributes, methods, and inheritance relationships.
    - Ensure proper encapsulation.
    - Implement console menus for interaction.

5. **Documentation**
    - Provide a **report** containing:
        - Requirement analysis
        - UML class diagram
        - Design and Implementation notes
        - Include the Git repository address or the source code as an annex to the report.

6. **Presentation & Oral Exam**
    - Run your application in front of the instructor.
    - Present and explain your UML class diagram and report.
    - Defend your design and code (why you chose certain classes, relationships, etc.).

---

## Deliverables
- Source code (`.java` files) organized in packages.
- UML Class diagram (hand-drawn or tool-based).
- Documentation report (PDF file).
- Running console application to be demonstrated during oral exam.

## Evaluation Criteria
***
The assignment will be evaluated based on two primary components:

1) Project Implementation: The quality and effectiveness of the project you implement.

2) Oral Exam Performance: Your performance during the oral exam, which will take place during your lab class in Week 8( the week starting October 20, 2025 ).

- **Correctness** (Does the application meet the requirements?).
- **Object-Oriented Design** (Proper use of class, inheritance, encapsulation).
- **Code Quality** (Readable, well-structured, meaningful names).
- **UML Diagram** (Accurate and consistent with implementation).
- **Documentation** (Completeness and clarity).
- **Oral Defense** (Understanding and ability to explain design and code).

---

## Oral Exam Requirement

The oral exam is **mandatory** as part of the evaluation process. Students will be assessed 
based on their understanding of the material presented in their **reports** and **source code**.

### **During the Oral Exam:**
- Reports must be **open** and accessible.
- Source code must be **ready to show** in the IDE.
- Application must be **ready to run** for demonstration.

---

## Group Work
Students must complete the assignment **individually**.  

---

## Report Structure
While there is no standard template for the report, it must include the following essential components:

### 1. Cover Page
Student Information: Include your full name, student ID, course name, and date of submission.

Title of the Report: Clearly state the title of your study or project.

### 2. Study Explanation
The report must provide the explanation of your study, including:

- Objective: Clearly outline the purpose and goals of your study.
- Requirement analysis
- UML class diagram
- Design and Implementation notes
- The Git repository address or the source code as an annex to the report.
- Conclusion: Summarize the key points and findings of your study.

### 3. Additional Recommendations

Ensure that your report is well-organized and free of grammatical errors.

Use clear headings and subheadings to enhance readability.

---

## Email Submission

Students are required to attach their report as a PDF file and submit it via **email (cceken@ku.edu.kz)** before the oral examination.

* Email Subject: Use the following format for the subject line of your email:
    - ict-assignment1-StudentName
* File Naming: Ensure that the report file is named appropriately, using the following format:
    - StudentName-Report.pdf
---

## Technology Requirements
Students are **required** to use the following technologies for their project:
- **Java** for implementation

---

## Late Submission and Oral Exam Policy
Students must submit their **reports and source code** before the **oral exam** (during their lab class in **Week 8**), 
as the oral exam time is crucial for evaluation.

If students are unable to attend the scheduled oral exam, they will be allowed to defend their project one week 
later during lab class hours.

However, this late defense of the oral exam will result in a 20% penalty on the total grade.

**Please note that there will not be another opportunity to defend the project beyond this timeframe.**

---

### By adhering to these guidelines and policies, you will ensure that your submission is complete and meets the evaluation criteria. 

***Good luck with your projects and oral exams!***
